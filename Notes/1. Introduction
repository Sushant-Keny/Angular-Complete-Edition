What is Angular?
----------------
* JavaScript Framework
* Single page applications
* Fast - As we don't need to go to the server for getting every html page
* A nice user experience
* Easy to develop


Angular Versioning
------------------
* Angular 1 === AngularJS
* Angular 2 - Complete re-write
* Angular 3 was skipped
* Angular 4 - 9


Angular CLI
-----------
* Create new Angular Project, Components, Services, etc
* Run the Angular Application in the development mode as it optimizes the code heavily and make some changes in the code before running
* Builds the Angular Application for production
* Takes care to convert TypeScript code into JavaScript while Node is used to bundle it
* Node.js is used for bundling and for npm
* npm is also used to manage the dependencies of Angular libraries


Create your first application
-----------------------------
* ng new MyFirstApplication
* Rename MyFirstApplication to My First Application
* Start the Application: ng serve


Project Structure
-----------------
* package.json - Dependencies and development dependencies of the application
* node_modules - Dependencies get installed in the node_modules folder
* e2e - Includes the code of end-to-end testing
* src - Source code/Development code
* app.component.html - Contains the html code used by the component
* app.component.ts - Typescript files that wires up html, css and business logic
* <app-root> in rendered page is the custom tag which we have created using Angular
- In component we have specified which tag should our component be referred as using selector property of @Component decorator


* Data binding
--------------
- Data can be binded to any tag using {{<<variable name of the component.ts>>}} syntax
- If you want to bind or send data from html to component we have to use ngModel directive provided by Angular
- We cannot directly use [(ngModel)] because it's unknown for Angular
- So we have to import a package named @angular/forms which provides FormsModule which further provides ngModel directive in the app.module.ts which has everything a component needs

In this way we can create multiple components and re-use them in our application


What is TypeScript?
-------------------
* Layer over JavaScript
* Type strict
* Helps to optimize the code as per V8 engine's requirement
* Many features & design patterns using TypeScript


Setup Bootstrap in Angular
-------------------------
* Install Bootstrap: npm i --save bootstrap
* Navigate to angular.json
- angular.json: CLI configuration file
- Find styles array and add path of bootstrap in that styles array
- Below is the example

	"styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css",
              "src/styles.css"
        ],

Note: style.css code will be used by every component
