Using Services And Dependency Injection
=======================================

What are Services?
------------------
- Used to avoid the duplication of code
  For e.g. For logging we can create logger services, where it can be used by all over the application
- Services can be used for data storage and the central repository too
  For e.g. User Service for all the user components where service can fetch all the users, update the user's data, delete the user and many more
- Services is one of the main building block in Angular same as Components, Directives
- Communication between the components


Services in action
------------------
Take a look at Services & DI with commit "Transform the code to use services"


Hierarchical Injector
---------------------
- AppModule - Same instance of Service is available Application-wide
- AppComponent - Same instance of Service is available for all Components (but not for other services)
- Any other component - Same instance of Service is available for the Component and it's child components


Inject the instance of service to another service
-------------------------------------------------
- Add the service in the provider array of AppModule
- Add the @Injectable() decorator to the service which needs another service injected into itself
- Get the service's instance via. constructor Injection
